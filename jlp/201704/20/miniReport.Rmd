## Accomplishments 
- [Added AUC to the ROC curve plots.](./ROC.html)
- started on ROC images.

### ROC Image idea
Given the scatterplot of Cell/Protein points colored by IHC, 
compute the Sensitivity and Specificity for the classifier defined by   
g_n(x) = 1 if Protein > a and Cell > b   
g_n(x) = 0 otherwise.   

For a sensible discritization of the plane.



I think this is what we're after. Right?
